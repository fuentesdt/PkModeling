The nrrd files in this folder are very small images for basic testing.

TestBasic* are (2, 1, 1) images with a float value per voxel. 
They differ in the 2nd voxel.

TestConc* are (2, 1, 1) images with a 36-component vector per voxel (representing a concentration curve).
The vectors in both images are different. The difference begins in the 8th vector component (before they are the same).
